## General Info
A timed quiz that will load onto the webpage and dynamically respond to the quiz-takers input.

The quiz will also store the users score and name, then subsequently add it to the High Scores list. 

If the user runs out of time organically, or causes the timer to hit zero due to negative answers, they 
will receive a "Times up!" message and be invited to try again.

## Technologies
This project is created with:
- [HTML](https://html.com/)
- [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html)
- [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/)

## Updates planned
- Locate bugs and squash bug(s) that is/are preventing the timeLeft function from correctly deprecating the time left by 10 seconds for every wrong answer. 
- Locate bugs and destroy bug(s) that is/are preventing the user score from caculating. 
- Locate and obliterate bug(s) that are/is preventing the incorrect anwers from reliably turning red and console logging "incorrect" when chosen; current status is intermittent functionality
- Create code to allow the user to save their score and then append that score to the High Scores area using local storage. 

## Outside resources
This project was used with the knowledge gained from my boot camp, my previous assignments, and a helpful YouTube guid for the overall quiz design. The video can be found here:
